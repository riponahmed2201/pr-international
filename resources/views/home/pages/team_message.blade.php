                            Having 14 years’ experience of doing business with the Defence Ministry, it will be a priority for me
                            to ensure the smooth and speedy implementation of defence deals and projects. I have some far-
                            fetched idea that there is always something to do for Director General Defence Purchase. I
                            believe having a core team with the combination of technology graduates &amp; Business
                            graduates, can stimulate and offer many different perspectives on the challenges we face and
                            produce success to get more projects.

                            The focused execution of P.R. International’s growth strategy enables us to achieve strong results. While
                            we are excited about our previous year’s results, we continue to refine the execution of our business
                            connection strategy, which will be paramount given the renewed faith principals and our clients shown
                            to us. Our company realizes the importance of pursuing business connectivity in the ever expanding sea
                            of opportunity through technology leadership and geographic expansion. On behalf of our management,
                            I give thanks to our principals and clients for their continued support.
